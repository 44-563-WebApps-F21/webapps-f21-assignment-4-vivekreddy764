<h6 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h6>  <p class="speech">Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord
Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.

<h6 class="name hunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It
means a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be
delighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.
Do you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to
go anywhere.</p>

<h6 class="gerald">GERALD.</h6>  <p class="speech">Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord
Illingworth had made me such an offer.</p>

myself worthy of it.</p>
