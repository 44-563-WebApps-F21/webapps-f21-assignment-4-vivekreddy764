<h6 class="name gerald option1">GERALD.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord
Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.</p><br>

<h6 class="name hunstanton option1">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It
means a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be
delighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.
Do you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to
go anywhere.</p><br>

<h6 class="name gerald option1">GERALD.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord
Illingworth had made me such an offer.</p><br>

<p class="stage-direction option1">[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]</p><br>

<h6 class="name hunstanton option1">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come
up and meet him.</p>  <p class="stage-direction option1">[_To Footman_.]</p>  <p class="speech option1">Just wait, Francis.</p> 
 <p class="stage-direction option1">[_Writes letter_.]</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as
you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.</p><br>

<h6 class="name gerald option1">GERALD.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show
myself worthy of it.</p><br>
