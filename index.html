<p class="stage-direction">[SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
large yew tree_.]</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1"> I believe this is the first English country house you
have stayed at, Miss Worsley?</p><br>

<h6 class="name hester option1">HESTER.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">Yes, Lady Caroline.</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p><br>

<h6 class="name hester option1">HESTER.</h6>  <p class="speech option1"> We have not many.</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1"> LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p class="speech option1"> Have you any country?  What we should call country?</p><br>

<h6 class="name hester option1"> HESTER.</h6>  <p class="stage-direction option1">[_Smiling_.]</p> <p class="speech option1"> We have the largest country in the world, Lady
Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
big as France and England put together.</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1"> LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.</p>
<p class="stage-direction option1">[_To_ SIR JOHN.]</p>  <p class="speech option1">John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</p><br>

<h6 class="name john option1"> SIR JOHN.</h6>  <p class="speech option1"> I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</p><br>

<h6 class="caroline option1"> LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
little lax about the people she asks down here.</p><p class="stage-direction option1">[_To_ SIR JOHN.]</p><p class="speech option1">Jane
mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p><br>

<h6 class="name john option1">SIR JOHN.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his
name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.</p><br>

<h6 class="name hester option1">HESTER.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord
Brancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t
believe she ran away more than once.</p><br>

<h6 class="name hester option1">HESTER.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady
Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to
have taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is
right in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,
one never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not
considered the thing.</p><br>

<h6 class="name hester option1">HESTER.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">In America those are the people we respect most.</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">I have no doubt of it.</p><br>

<h6 class="name hester option1">HESTER.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so
sincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come
across.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young
lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.
English women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They
show them then.</p><br>

<h6 class="name hester option1">HESTER.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young
man and a young girl?</p><br>

<p class="stage-direction option1">[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a
cushion_.]</p><br>

<h6 class="name caroline option1">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying
what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful
power of selection.  It is quite a gift.</p><br>

<h6 class="name hunstanton option1">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  <p class="speech option1">Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit
in very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will
carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.</p>  <p class="stage-direction option1">[_To
Footman_.]</p>  <p class="speech option1">The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.
Get the Shetland.</p>  <p class="stage-direction option1">[_Exit Footman for shawl_.]</p><br>
