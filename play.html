<p>[SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
large yew tree_.]</p><br>

<h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p> I believe this is the first English country house you
have stayed at, Miss Worsley?</p>

<h6>HESTER.</h6>  <p>Yes, Lady Caroline.</p>

<h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p>

<h6>HESTER.</h6>  <p> We have not many.</p>

<h6> LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p> Have you any country?  What we should call country?</p>

<h6> HESTER.</h6>  <p>[_Smiling_.]</p> <p> We have the largest country in the world, Lady
Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
big as France and England put together.</p>

<h6> LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.</p>
<p>[_To_ SIR JOHN.]</p>  <p>John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</p>

<h6> SIR JOHN.</h6>  <p> I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</p>

<h6> LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
little lax about the people she asks down here.</p><p>[_To_ SIR JOHN.]</p><p>Jane
mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p>

<h6>SIR JOHN.</h6>  <p>Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.</p>

<h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his
name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.</p>

<h6>HESTER.</h6>  <p>I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.</p>

<h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord
Brancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t
believe she ran away more than once.</p>

<h6>HESTER.</h6>  <p>Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.</p>

<h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady
Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to
have taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is
right in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,
one never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not
considered the thing.</p>

<h6>HESTER.</h6>  <p>In America those are the people we respect most.</p>

<h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>I have no doubt of it.</p>

<h6>HESTER.</h6>  <p>Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so
sincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come
across.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.</p>

<h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young
lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.
English women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They
show them then.</p>

<h6>HESTER.</h6>  <p>Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young
man and a young girl?</p>

<p>[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a
cushion_.]</p>

<h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  <p>We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying
what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful
power of selection.  It is quite a gift.</p>

<h6>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  <p>Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit
in very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will
carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.</p>  <p>[_To
Footman_.]</p>  <p>The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.
Get the Shetland.</p>  <p>[_Exit Footman for shawl_.]</p>
